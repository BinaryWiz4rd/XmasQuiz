Create a mobile app in Kotlin that: 
1. Randomly generates Christmas greetings  
2. Suggests random Christmas gifts. 
3. Occasionally shows a surprise from the Grinch, who messes everything up. 
Functional Requirements 
1. Main Screen:

▪ "Generate Greeting" – displays a randomly selected Christmas 
greeting. 

▪ "Generate Gift" – displays a randomly selected gift (e.g., "Socks," 
"Lego Set"). 

o A list or history of generated greetings/gifts. 

3. Grinch Interaction: 
Randomly, after several clicks, instead of a greeting or gift, a message from the Grinch appears, 
such as:

▪ "The Grinch stole your presents!" 

▪ "Oops! Wishes canceled, the Grinch was here first!" 

o Optionally: the screen changes color, or an animation appears. 

5. Christmas-themed Design:

o A simple, festive design using images or colors (e.g., red, green, white).
